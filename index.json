On classic sources of information, these challenges are usually handled by qualifying content (truth likelihood), and emitters (actor credibility). To adapt this approach to social media, we use influence models, behaviour analysis and community detection for emitters characterisation. This can be combined with the exploitation of knowledge bases for automatic fact checking. This paper proposes a review of this multi-domain challenge.","tags":[],"title":"Manipulation and fake news detection on social media: a two domain survey, combining social network analysis and knowledge bases exploitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacques Everwyn","Bruno Zanuttini","Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","Sylvain Gatepaille","Stephan Brunessaux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1570539600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570539600,"objectID":"d62228d25539814f586828b7b2a3f91e","permalink":"https://jacquesev.github.io/academic_page/publication/nato2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T15:00:27+02:00","relpermalink":"/academic_page/publication/nato2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we review link prediction techniques for situation awareness in a maritime context, and draw conclusions on how the addition of attributes in a dynamic graph model could improve results on this task.","tags":["deep learning","knowledge graphs","link prediction","situational awareness"],"title":"Achieving maritime situational awareness using knowledge graphs: a study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacques Everwyn","Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","Bruno Zanuttini","Sylvain Gatepaille","Stephan Brunessaux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1561986000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561986000,"objectID":"9efd6859011f8373c36ce7c5bf14dffd","permalink":"https://jacquesev.github.io/academic_page/publication/pfia2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T15:00:19+02:00","relpermalink":"/academic_page/publication/pfia2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we review link prediction techniques for situation awareness in a maritime context, and draw conclusions on how the addition of attributes in a dynamic graph model could improve results on this task.","tags":[],"title":"Link Prediction on Dynamic Attributed Knowledge Graphs for Maritime Situational Awareness","type":"publication"}]
